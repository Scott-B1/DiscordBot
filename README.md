# DiscordBot
An earlier (partially redacted) version of my discord bot, ported from my private repository.

Once setup, run using `node mybot.js`

Configuration required in the config.json file, and replacing channel/server IDs inside mybot.js

Commands include a version check, a ping test, and posting to multiple channels at once (with specific user ID validation).
